This is a Terraria parody of Rogue Lineage:
The races in this mod aren't exactly balanced; except maybe between each other.
Rogue Lineage itself has had unbalanced and powerful/weak races, so the races in this mod were made with a very decent amount of power.
I might reconsider making a version of this where the races are more closely balanced with the races of the Authentic mod, but it probably won't happen for awhile. 
It might not be Rogue Lineage themed if I do [DW when it comes out, maybe?], but that's not something you should count on happening.
Any lore heard from the Race's lore pages may be incorrect or at most somewhat true / speculation. (There's also tiny bits of new "lore" related to terraria stuff but that's just made up for fun.)

The sounds you may hear from certain abilities are used in Rogue Lineage. If they are infact copyrighted and disallowed for this mod to have, then I will remove them.
Only the Morvid sound is mostly home made. I took a crow sound and went with it.
{If you know for certain that the sounds are copyrighted (or at least the ones within the mod), then contact me on discord (martypotty#9781) or on youtube.}

^ They're balanced between eachother, not with the Authentic Races. New races are at risk of an imbalance, so please send me feedback if you feel like one race is much stronger and or weaker compared to the others, and if I can I'll try to balance it out more.
Please do not ask me to add Dev races or Khei varients of a race. I'm not doing that right now and may not do that at all. Despite me asking this, I did love Dullahan and I was biased towards that one particular "khei" race. That's probably obvious by now, though! It's been in every icon! Haha!

Note; They are decently different from their Rogue counterparts.
Despite this, you may still see extreme exaggerations or similarities between the races of this mod and the races of Rogue Lineage.

Let me know how I can improve these if you'd like. [Martypotty#9781 is my discord.]

[c/FFFF00:Credit for what/who helped with the races]
[c/FFFF00:in this mod;]
Note: By help I mean that they helped me learn something or let me use something like an anti-negative regen thing/or because of let's say the exampliar code I was able to make this or that. I don't know how to code in C# properly, and so I needed help knowing if something existed or not.

MrPlague's tutorial on how to make a race & the Exampliar code.
SM [Creator of the Steel race mod] for letting his race's code be read. Because I was able to look at it, it made me understand a couple more things about creating races and how I could add a little more. His description also inspired how I should make this one.
Also credit to SM again for helping me out with a way to cancel out negative health regen! [Like Poison!]
Pog(Karma) and Shaggy Overlord for answering a couple of my questions in the Discord when I was wondering about how to do something.
My Discord friends Soppy and Dowellz for helping me see if it worked well on Multiplayer when I first started on making this.
