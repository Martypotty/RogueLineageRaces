This is a Terraria parody of Rogue Lineage:
The races in this mod aren't exactly balanced; except maybe between each other.
Any lore heard from the Race's lore pages may be incorrect or at most somewhat true / speculation. (There're also tiny bits of new "lore" related to Terraria stuff but that's just made up for fun.)

Mod Homepage leads to a Google document about recent and past changes/additions*

The races in this addon are decently different from their Rogue counterparts.
Despite this fact, you will likely see some extreme exaggerations or similarities between most of the races of this mod and the races of Rogue Lineage. For example Gaian is tanky, Rigan has high mana regen, and Ashiin has multiple class-based stats. Also 15 out of the 16 races this addon adds have a unique ability and offer somewhat differing things!
The [c/3ABC7A:races] names are listed here! Scroll down if you'd like. It also lists some brief details about what has been done to them in this update.

It's possible that there wont be anymore content updates in 1.3 for this race addon [Or at least outside of fixes or balancing.] Knowing me though, there's still a chance that I may try to come back to updating this with more content while it is on 1.3; Especially if I struggle with or cannot completely learn how to do certain things on 1.4.


[c/606060:If this is updated, it'll likely be for tweaks /]
[c/606060:balancing. An additional race is not as likely.]

[c/913831:I might undo my endurance rework if I find a way to]
[c/913831:cap it off or heavily reduce all the external gains.]
[c/913831:However at the moment I do want to keep it this way.]
^ The races are only balanced between eachother and not with the Authentic Races. New (and now old) races are at risk of an imbalance, so please send me feedback if you feel like any of the races are much stronger and or weaker compared to the others. If I can I'll try to balance it out between them some more.
I might be planning on adding the rest of the races; or at least maybe 2-5 more.. Justtt not right now. I already have a basic concept ready for each of them, though even if I do go through with adding them into the mod it's still unlikely that they'll come out soon. [Unlike my first update which happened about a month later, lol.]



Let me know how I can improve these if you'd like! [Martypotty#9781 is my discord.]

[c/FFFF00:Credit for what/who helped with the races]
[c/FFFF00:in this mod;]
Note: By help I mean that they helped me learn something or let me use something like an anti-negative regen thing/or because of let's say the exampliar code I was able to make this or that. I don't know how to code in C# properly, and so I needed help knowing if something existed or not.

MrPlague's tutorial on how to make a race & the Exampliar code.
SM [Creator of the Steel race mod] for letting his race's code be read. Because I was able to look at it, it made me understand a couple more things about creating races and how I could add a little more. His description also inspired how I should make this one.
Also credit to SM again for helping me out with a way to cancel out negative health regen! [Like Poison!]
Pog(Karma) and Shaggy Overlord for answering a couple of my questions in the Discord when I was wondering about how to do something.
My Discord friends Soppy and Dowellz for helping me see if it worked well on Multiplayer when I first started on making this.

[c/606060:{If this mod frustrates you, please keep in mind]
[c/606060:that these people weren't directly involved in this]
[c/606060:creation, and might not have even known it entirely.]
[c/606060:Don't go to them, contact Martypotty#9781 instead.}]

[c/B266FF:If the main mod didn't work, this would've been]
[c/B266FF:difficult / probably wouldn't have happened by me.]
[c/B266FF:Credits for the "MrPlague's Authentic Races" mod.]
(I'm not 100% sure as to how I should credit the original mod exactly, but here it is!)

-MrPlague (spriter, animator, and coder)
-Mirsario (helped with cleaning up MrPlague's spaghetti code and did 90% of the custom race support)
-SnowMelon (adjusted some of the audio files)
-CrocWithShadws (betatester)
-Dragons Tired (betatester)
-Blaquestone (gameplay balance)
-Fallout_Patriot (gameplay balance, betatester)
-FullyVoided, suggester of the Kobold Race
-Pinsel, suggester and one of the creators of the Fluftrodon Race


-------------------------------------------
Note; Rogue Lineage itself had unbalanced and powerful/weak races, so the races in this mod were made with a very decent amount of power.
I might reconsider making a version of this where the races are more closely balanced with the races of the Authentic mod, but it probably won't happen for awhile, and it might not be Rogue Lineage themed if I do [DW, maybe?] but that's not something you should completely count on happening.

The sounds you may hear from certain abilities are used in Rogue Lineage. If they are infact copyrighted and disallowed for this mod to have, then I will remove them.
Only the Morvid sound is mostly home made. I took a non-copyrighted crow sound and went with it.
{If you know for certain that the sounds are copyrighted (or at least the ones within the mod), then contact me on discord (martypotty#9781) or on youtube.}

Technically on a hiatus currently outside of new content or balancing/fixes.

You're not crazy! I moved some stuff down here.
