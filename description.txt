This is a terraria parody of Rogue Lineage:
The races in this mod aren't exactly balanced;
Rogue lineage itself has had unbalanced and powerful/weak races, so the races in this mod were made with a very decent amount of power.
I might consider making a version of this where the races are more closely balanced with the races of the Authentic mod, but it probably won't happen for awhile. 
It might not be rogue lineage themed if I do [DW when it comes out, maybe?], but that's not something you should count on happening.

[c/606060:If this is updated, it'll likely be for tweaks /]
[c/606060:balancing. An additional race is not as likely.]

[c/3ABC7A:Races]
Ashiin
Gaian
Castellan
Rigan
Dullahan
Haseldan

^ They're balanced between eachother, Not with the Authentic Races.

Note; They are decently different from their rogue counterparts.
Despite this, you will still see exaggerations or similarities
between the races of this mod and the races of Rogue Lineage.

Let me know how I can improve these if you'd like. [Martypotty#9781 is my discord.]

MrPlague's tutorial on how to make a race & the Exampliar code
SM [Creator of the Steel race mod] for letting his race's code be read. Because I was able to look at it, it made me understand a couple more things about the mod and how to add a little more. His description also inspired how I should make this one.
Also credit to SM for helping me out with a way to cancel out negative health regen! [Like Poison!]
Pog(Karma) and Shaggy Overlord for answering a couple of my questions in the Discord when I was wondering about how to do something.
My Discord friends Soppy and Dowellz for helping me see if it worked well on Multiplayer.
